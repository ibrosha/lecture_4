# OBJECT!!!

### What is a object in java script ? 

- In JavaScript, an object is a standalone 
entity, with properties and type. 
Compare it with a cup, for example. A 
cup is an object, with properties. A cup 
has a color, a design, weight, a material 
it is made of, etc. The same way, 
JavaScript objects can have properties, 
which define their characteristics.
Everything is an object in JavaScript.

- JavaScript object is a nonprimitive data-type that allows you to 
store multiple collections of data

# Destructuring AND spread in object !!!
- The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it 
possible to unpack properties from object, into distinct variables


- Destructuring is used to create varibles from array items or object properties. Spread syntax is used to unpack iterables such as arrays, objects, and function calls. Rest parameter syntax will create an array from an indefinite number of values.

# How the this keyword works !!!

- The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name (because a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter).
- this is NOT a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.
